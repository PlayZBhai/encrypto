### Description:
Encrypto is a safe file transfer method to use rather than using files with password which can be cracked using brute force and other password cracking methods. Encrypt uses a ransomware technology for good. It encrypts any application or file and creates a key for it with an unique token in "/keys" folder. The key can be sent securely to the person who you want to access the file. Means post your file publicly but the one who can access it is in your hands!

Encrypto is
- ✅Safe
- ✅Fast
- ✅One Time Key 
- ✅Unique token that cannot be cracked
- ✅A new way to share files securely

## Encrypting
- Step 1: Browse the file you want to encrypt
- Step 2: Give the name of the key
- Step 3: Encrypt the File
- Step 4: Share the file anywhere
- Step 5: Give the key, (do not loose it, cannot be recovered) to anyone you'd like
- Step 6: The receiver must have to use Encrypto in order to Decrypt the file
Encrypto can encrypt any file from text files to images to videos to apllications.

## Decrypting
- Step 1: Browse the encrypted file or apllication
- Step 2: Browse the key it is usually located at the "keys" folder. We'll add a option later to access it through app but as for now it is on the "installed encrypto directory/keys" Also make sure you use the right key in order to decrypt
- Step 3: Decrypt the file and you're ready to read or run it

### A note for the people who are using it to encrpyt text files and other kind of code
Encrypto encrypts the binary data inside any file using a specific token. When encrypting a text file it may not look as it is for applications, you can still open the text file and edit it but the text file will be not readable by any human being
